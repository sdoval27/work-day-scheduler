- Create a site that uses third party API's to log and track a user's schedule throughout the work day.


### Usage:
- When opening the page, the website should appear as so:

![StartPage](./assets/images/WDS-home.png)

- This calendar follows a typical 9am to 5pm work schedule with hourly time blocks that change color as the day progresses. 

- As displayed here, gray blocks represent hours that have already passed, red is the current hour, and green highlights the future hours.
